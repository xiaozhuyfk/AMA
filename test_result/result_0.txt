The '''Bob Marley Museum''' is a [[museum]] in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], [[Jamaica]], dedicated to the [[reggae]] [[musician]] [[Bob Marley]].
'''Vincent Ford''' (c. 1940 &ndash; 28 December 2008), known as "Tata" or "Tartar", was a [[Jamaica]]n [[songwriter]] best known for receiving writing credit for "[[No Woman, No Cry]]", the [[reggae]] song made famous by [[Bob Marley & The Wailers]], as well as three other [[Bob Marley]] songs.
During the mid-70s, after attending a concert by [[Bob Marley]] (at which he was fascinated as much by Marley's shamanistic presence as by his music), Pierce became deeply engrossed in [[reggae]]; eventually he would travel to [[Jamaica]] to explore the music, a trip that left him ambivalent about the music's relevance to American culture.
Forde can be heard presenting the radio documentaries ''Behind The Smile: The Real Life of [[Bob Marley]]'' and ''Island Rock'' to mark the 40th anniversary of [[Jamaica]]n independence.
