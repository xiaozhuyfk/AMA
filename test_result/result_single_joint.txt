1505when did charles goodyear invented rubber?	[u"During the early 1830's he began inventing, filing six patents between 1830 and 1834, and during this period became interested in rubber, which he tried - unsuccessfully - to use in some of his mechanical inventions."]	[u'In 1839, after five years of intensive experimentation, Goodyear accidentally dropped a rubber sample that had been mixed with sulphur and litharge (lead oxide) on a hot stove.', u'However, the sheeting lacked durability, and became soft and sticky  in warm weather, and the project failed.', u'Hayward patented this process and had discovered all the essentials of  vulcanization : rubber, sulphur and heat.', u'In 1838 Goodyear bought the Eagle India Rubber Company of Woburn,  MA from Nathaniel M. Hayward, whom he hired to work for  him.', u'Perkin discovered mauve in 1856, which led to the foundation of the aniline dye industry,  used in the manufacture of rubber tyres.', u'A gifted American inventor, whose passion for experiments with rubber in the 1840s led to his invention of vulcanised rubber in 1844.', u"All  these products reacted to weather, becoming hard in winter and soft in summer - problems of which Goodyear learned in the summer  of 1834 when he visited the company's New York salesroom.", u'Earlier, on 16 April 1844, Goodyear had also been granted  a French patent for vulcanization, but unfortunately was soon afterwards  deprived of all rights under this patent because it was discovered that he  had sent several American-made rubber shoes to France before taking out his  French patent.', u'He first went to England, where articles made under his patents had been displayed at  the International Exhibition of 1851, and where he unsuccessfully attempted  to establish two factories.', u"During the early 1830's he began inventing,  filing six patents between 1830 and 1834, and during this period became  interested in rubber, which he tried - unsuccessfully - to use in some of  his mechanical inventions.", u"Meanwhile, having read of and experimented with Goodyear's  process, in November 1843 Thomas Hancock was granted an English patent for vulcanization, depriving Goodyear of all profits from the English manufacture of rubber.", u"In 1826 Amasa and Charles Goodyear established the first retail domestic hardware store in the United States at Philadelphia, but the business went  bankrupt in 1830, and from then on Goodyear was mostly poor and often in debtor's prisons, frequently selling furniture and household goods in order  to feed his growing family.", u'Hayward had earlier discovered that rubber treated with sulphur lost its stickiness, and had added small amounts of sulphur to some of his  rubber compounds, sometimes dusting sulphur over the surface of his rubber  fabrics and exposing them to the sun (a process known as ""solarization"").', u"In 1855 Goodyear travelled to France,  where he organized a large exhibit on his work for the Exposition  Universelle in Paris for which Napoleon III awarded him the Grand Medal  of Honor and the Cross of the Legion d'Honneur, but in the same year a  French company that manufactured vulcanized rubber by his process failed,  and in December 1855 Goodyear was imprisoned in the Paris debtors' prison.", u"Goodyear immediately applied the new process to the manufacture of various articles, although his work was constantly interrupted by periods of extreme poverty, ill health, and time spent in debtors' prison.", u'The term ""vulcanization"" was coined in England by Thomas Hancock\'s friend,  William Brockedon - after Vulcan, the Roman god of fire and metalworking -  and Goodyear adopted it in his  patents and writings.', u'By this time Goodyear had arrived in Europe, where he hoped to begin manufacture.', u'Twelve years later, the rubber industry arrived in the  United States, when the India Rubber Company of Roxbury, MA began  manufacturing rubber bottles, raincoats, and overshoes.', u'The chemical reaction of rubber and sulphur at a high temperature which followed, transformed the rubber into a stable, versatile commercial product with hundreds of uses.', u'However, his vulcanization process was so simple that many pirated it and as a result he spent a great deal of time fighting  numerous infringements of his patent in court.', u'By 1841 he  was manufacturing rubber sheet goods,  but  in 1843 he was finally declared bankrupt and was returned to prison.', u'In 1859 he moved to Washington D.C.', u"During the 1840's Goodyear's discovery saved the ailing rubber industry and converted it into a multimillion-dollar enterprise.", u"Having already  been impressed by rubber's elasticity, plasticity, strength, durability,  non-conductance of electricity and resistance to water, from this point  Goodyear became obsessed with discovering a method of treating rubber so  that it would lose its stickiness and susceptibility to extremes of  heat and cold.", u'His first success came in 1835, when he received  a silver medal from the Mechanics Institute for his development of a nitric  acid treatment for the production of rubber sheeting, and in 1837 he  contracted for the manufacture of mailbags for the U.S. government by this  process.', u"The modern rubber industry had been originated in 1820 by the English coachmaker and inventor Hancock, who opened the world's first  rubber factory in London, England, and was for a time in partnership with Charles Macintosh.", u'He was  finally granted his first patent on 15 June 1844 (U.S. patent number 3633),  and profits from manufactured goods and licence fees at last allowed him to pay his creditors.', u"Goodyear returned to New Haven in 1858, reputedly pawning his wife's jewelry  in order to pay for the passage home."]	0	EMPTY	base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences	NONE	Charles Goodyear

1772when was christopher columbus first expedition?	[u'1492 Conquest of Paradise']	[u'Less than three weeks later, Queen Isabella, whom he considered his most important patron, was dead, and Columbus resumed his lobbying at court, where his son Diego was well established.', u'Executing ringleaders, he also imposed a gold-tax on the hostile native population, threatening those unwilling to work for the colonizers with either death or shipment to Europe as slaves.', u'During the warmer months, he became a seagoing entrepreneur, sailing in 1477 to Iceland (where he may first have heard tales of the unknown land that lay to the west) and Ireland with the Portuguese marine, and in 1478 to Madeira in order to buy sugar as an agent for the Lisbon branch of the Genoese firm of Centurioni.', u'From Dominica, he then discovered a string of further islands which he named Maria Galante, Guadalupe, and Montserrat, and then sighted a further group to the northeast, which he named the Virgin Islands, before reaching San Juan (now Puerto Rico) and finally Hispaniola on 23 November.', u"He then set out for Spain in the 'Nina', on 16 January 1493, enduring a stormy and difficult voyage home, and arrived at Palos triumphant, carrying gold, parrots, spices and human captives, on 15 March 1493.", u'His voyages were triggered by the Treaty of Tordesillas.', u"Attempting to return to Hispaniola, the expedition just made it to Jamaica, where his two remaining ships went aground in St. Anne's Bay on 25 June, and where they were then to be marooned for a whole year while a message was sent by canoe to Santo Domingo asking for help.", u'He explored the coast of the Central American isthmus until 1 May 1503, reaching the coast of Honduras, discovering the gold-rich province of Veragua and the habour of Porto Bello.', u'His ship was sunk off Cape St. Vincent in southwest Portugal, and from this point Columbus based himself in Lisbon, where his brother Bartholomew was working as a cartographer.', u'He received a warmer welcome than expected at court, where he was reunited with his two sons, Diego and Fernando, and immediately pressed his plans for a third voyage.', u"( Pinzon, in the 'Pinta', arrived a few days later but, exhausted by the strain of the voyage, he died on 20 March.)", u"On Christmas Day, the 'Santa Maria' ran aground on a reef and became a total loss, and Columbus, with the help of a local Taino Indian chief, Guacanagar\xed, set up a stockade on the northern coast of the island, named it La Navidad, and posted 39 men to guard it against his return.", u"Columbus' career as a seaman began in 1476, when he sailed with a convoy of Genoese ships from Chios in the Aegean for Portugal, England and Flanders.", u'It was during this period that he had the idea of sailing due west from the Canary Islands on latitude 28N, which he believed would lead him to Japan, and began an extensive course of self-education, reading works on geography, astronomy and astrology, and travel.', u'Still troubled by the spectre of Portuguese expansion, Ferdinand and Isabella were eventually persuaded to make a  further investment, and on 30 May 1498 Columbus was able to sail from Sanlucar with a fleet of six ships, three filled with explorers and three with provisions for the settlement on Hispaniola.', u'In 1478 or 1479, Columbus married Felipa Moniz Perestrello, a member of a prominent but impoverished Portuguese family, with whom he soon afterwards settled on the island of Porto Santo, off Madeira, where their only son, Diego, was born in 1480.', u'Lisbon was at that time an important maritime city, a meeting place of seamen who sailed regularly to Africa and Madeira, and a centre of the arts, of cosmography and astronomy.', u'Refused permission to land, he was forced to shelter from a hurricane further along the coast, and during July made the first recorded crossing of the Caribbean, arriving off Bonacca Island on 30 July, an achievement of which he was particularly proud.', u'Between 1482 and 1484 he traded along the Guinea coast and made at least one voyage to the Portuguese fortress of Sao Jorge da Mina on the Gold Coast of equatorial West Africa, gaining knowledge of the Atlantic wind systems.', u"Finally, Ferdinand and Isabella decided to appoint a member of the royal household, Francisco de Bobadilla, as Governor of the colony over Columbus' head, who arrived in Santo Domingo in August 1500.", u"Columbus's first great achievement was his decision to sail via the Canary Islands, off the northwest African mainland, rather than via the Azores (where the belt of westerly winds had defeated previous sailors to the west).", u'His failure was one of temperament - he was excessively self- confident and arrogant, and a poor administrator - but he remains a remarkable explorer, for the extent of his navigation and for his additions to geographical tradition.', u'He and his brothers received a royal pardon in December, but were never again appointed to positions of administrative responsibility.', u'His discovery was sanctioned by Pope Alexander VI.', u"Columbus' humiliating homecoming at Cadiz at the end of October 1500 caused a public outcry, and a month later the King and Queen ordered his release.", u'Meanwhile, Columbus had begun a long liaison with Beatriz de Enriques, who bore him a son, Fernando, and had hispanicized his name, signing himself Cristobal Colon.', u'Finally, in March 1502, permission was granted for a fourth expedition with a fleet of only four ships, and two months later Columbus set sail from Cadiz, forbidden to put into harbour at Hispaniola.', u'On arrival at Sanlucar de Barrameda on 7 November, Columbus was conveyed to Seville, but was not summoned to court.', u'When Bobadilla found that the Colon brothers were sending rebellious Spaniards to the gallows and that they refused to accept his authority, he had all three put in irons and transported back to Spain.', u"After almost a month in the Canary Islands, he set out from San Sebastian de la Gomera on 6 September, and early in October, after several false sightings of land and trouble from a potentially mutinous crew, Columbus took Martin Pinzon's advice and altered course to the south-west.", u'Convinced that he was in the Orient, Columbus spent the next three months cruising around the Caribbean, discovering Cuba and Hispaniola (Haiti), where he found at least enough gold and prosperity to secure his triumphant return to Spain, although he felt increasingly anxious concerning his inability to find conclusive evidence of Asia .', u"Twelve ships were sent back to Spain with Antonio de Torres, bearing the bad news about Navidad (and growing complaints about Columbus' methods of government) while in March Columbus set out to explore the central region of the island (Cibao), where he established a fortified settlement, named San Tomas.", u'Returning to Lisbon in 1484, Columbus attempted unsuccessfully to find a patron for a voyage of exploration in the Atlantic, and then suffered another major setback when his wife died later the same year.', u'Here Columbus met the astronomer-friar Antonio de Marchena, and through him Juan Perez, Count of Medinaceli, a grandee of Spain and owner of a large merchant fleet.', u'Here he picked up the northeast trade winds, trusting to the Westerlies for his return.', u"On his fourth voyage he took Regiomontanus' navigational tables.", u'Leaving 56 men there, he returned to La Isabel, where he found his colonists mutinous.', u'Three weeks later he reached a new island which he named Martinique, and from there, in defiance of royal orders, made straight for Santo Domingo.', u'They later moved to Funchal, the capital of Madeira, where Columbus gained experience sailing the south Atlantic.', u'The sovereigns were now convinced of the need for a rapid second voyage in order to bring Christianity to the new territories and to develop them as a Spanish colony, and during the next few months seventeen ships ships were fitted out at Seville, by, among others, the future explorer Amerigo Vespucci (after whom the New World would be named).', u'Leaving the Canaries on 13 October, Columbus tried a new route to the southwest, more directly in the path of the wind, and reached Dominica (in the Lesser Antilles, known today as the Leeward Islands) on 3 November.', u"He wrote a series of memoirs to the King on the Indies and their gold, but when at last he was admitted an audience  with Ferdinand in May 1505, he was received sympathetically, but not granted the reappointment of 'Viceroy' he sought.", u"During these years of waiting, Bartholomew Columbus is believed to have visited England in an abortive attempt to interest Henry VII in his brother's proposed enterprise, and then settled in France, intending to approach the French monarch.", u'Believing Venezuela to be yet another island or land mass off the Malay Peninsula, in August 1498 he returned to Hispaniola, where he found that construction of the new capital, Santo Domingo, had already started.', u"There he received both wealth and honurs from Ferdinand and Isabella who, in addition to the agreed titles, appointed him 'Viceroy and Governor of the Islands which have been discovered in the Indies', and gave him the right to bear royal symbols on his coat of arms.", u'As a result, in the summer of 1485, Columbus left Portugal for Spain, taking with him his five-year-old son, whom he placed in a Franciscan friary at La Rabida, near Huelva.', u'Columbus then traveled from Seville to Barcelona, where he was received at court amid great splendour at the beginning of April.', u"During this year, Columbus's health again deteriorated (he was now crippled with arthritis), and he had to cope with yet another mutiny among his men.", u'For the next eight years, Columbus sailed under the Portuguese flag, working during the winter months in partnership with his brother, while also learning Portuguese and elementary Latin.', u'Eventually two caravels arrived, and on 28 June 1504 Columbus sailed for Santo Domingo, and from there, on 12 September, on his last homeward voyage.', u'Four days later Columbus arrived at Navidad, where he found the fortress destroyed and all 39 men dead, and  chose as a safer site a position on the northern coast of the island, where in January 1494 he founded the first European city of the New World, naming it La Isabel in honour of the queen.', u'Meanwhile, back at the Spanish court, disquiet was growing over reports concerning the regime, and it was even rumoured that the Colon brothers were engaged in treasonable dealings with Genoese agents.', u'Finally, after surviving a hurricane (June 1495) and increasing difficulties with both the colonists and the natives, on 10 March 1496, Columbus set sail again for Spain, arriving at Cadiz on 11 June.', u'Land was sighted on 12 October, and later that day Columbus and the Pinzon brothers went ashore and took possession in the name of Ferdinand and Isabella, having in all probability reached the most westerly of the group of islands now known as the Bahamas, which Columbus named San Salvador.', u'Was influenced by Plethon.', u"Through Perez's influence, in the spring of 1486 Columbus was granted an audience with  King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of  Spain to argue his case.", u"In late April, leaving La Isabel under the control of his brother Diego, Columbus set sail in the 'Nina' towards Cuba (which he remained convinced was the mainland of Cathay), and in May discovered an island which he named Santiago (now Jamaica).", u'As a result, a commission was set up to investigate the proposal and four years later (1490) reported unfavorably.', u"During the return voyage to La Isabel Columbus became seriously ill and remained so for several months, but was greatly aided by the arrival from Europe of a second brother, Bartholomew Colon (or Columbus), who he made Governor of Hispaniola, an appointment which increased the growing resentment against the Colon family's administration."]	0	film.film_subject.films	base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences	Christopher
