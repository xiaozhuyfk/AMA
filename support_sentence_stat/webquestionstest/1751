Remove them or degrade them, and the empire is no more. Empire follows art and not vice versa as Englishmen suppose.', u'Humiliation sets armies marching, empires falling, breaks hearts and minds and souls.', u'We must annex those people. We can afflict them with our wise and beneficent government. We can introduce the novelty of thieves, all the way up from street-car pickpockets to municipal robbers and Government defaulters, and show them how amusing it is to arrest them and try them and then turn them loose -- some for cash and some for political influence. We can make them ashamed of their simple and primitive justice. We can make that little bunch of sleepy islands the hottest corner on earth, and array it in the moral splendor of our high and holy civilization. Annexation is what the poor islanders need. Shall we to men benighted, the lamp of life deny?', u'The conquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves, is not a pretty thing when you look into it.', u'To plunder, to slaughter, to steal, these things they misname empire; and where they make a wilderness, they call it peace.']	0
