This sentence of house arrest remained in effect throughout the last eight years of Galileo's life. During these last years, Galileo continued his research, even after his hearing and sight began to fail.   In 1634 he completed his 'Discorsi e dimostrazioni mathematiche intorno a due nuove scienze attenenti alla meccanica' ('Dialogue Concerning Two New Sciences'), which was smuggled out of Italy and published at Leiden in 1638,  and inspired much experimental work by such scientists as Torricelli,  Berti and Ricci Galileo's last telescopic discovery - that of the Moon's diurnal and monthly librations (wobbling from side to side) - was made in 1637, only a few months before he became blind.", u'Once he was totally blind (1638), Galileo was permitted to have his two friends, the geometrician Viviani and Torricelli, to live with him, to whom he was dictating his latest ideas on the theory of impact when he was seized with the slow fever that resulted in his death.', u"In 1591 on his father's death he resigned from  Pisa and returned to Florence.", u"He also composed an untitled treatise on motion, now generally referred to as 'De motu', which disproved the Aristotelian theory that bodies of different weights fall at different speeds, and instead developed a theory of falling bodies derived from the buoyancy principle of Archimedes, an idea previously published by Benedetti ."]	0	EMPTY
