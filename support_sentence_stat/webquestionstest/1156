Even the interpretation and use of words involves a process of free creation.', u'We have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course, language.', u'It is a mass language only in the same sense that its baseball slang is born of baseball players. That is, it is a language which is being molded by writers to do delicate things and yet be within the grasp of superficially educated people. It is not a natural growth, much as its proletarian writers would like to think so. But compared with it at its best, English has reached the Alexandrian stage of formalism and decay.', u'The common faults of American language are an ambition of effect, a want of simplicity, and a turgid abuse of terms.', u'Language is a skin: I rub my language against the other. It is as if I had words instead of fingers, or fingers at the tip of my words. My language trembles with desire.']	0
