In 1732 he left Sweden and travelled around Europe for four years, during which he visited almost all the main observatories of  the day, and worked with many of the leading 18th-century astronomers.", u'He was the first to realize from these observations that the aurora borealis involved magnetic forces.', u'He then travelled to Italy and then to Paris, where in 1735 he met the mathematician and  astronomer Maupertuis, who was preparing an expedition to measure  an arc of meridian in the far north, with the intention of verifying the  Newtonian theory that the Earth is a sphere flattened at the poles.', u'Maupertuis invited Celsius to join the expedition to Lapland, and in 1735 Celsius went to London, England in order to buy the necessary  astronomical instruments from the famous clock- and instrument-maker Graham.']	0	EMPTY

Public schools are the nurseries of all vice and immorality.', u'I was asked to memorize what I did not understand; and, my memory being so good, it refused to be insulted in that manner.', u'My plan of instruction is extremely simple and limited. They learn, on week-days, such coarse works as may fit them for servants. I allow of no writing for the poor. My object is not to make fanatics, but to train up the lower classes in habits of industry and piety.', u'Of all cursed places under the sun, where the hungriest soul can hardly pick up a few grains of knowledge, a girls boarding-school is the worst. They are called finishing schools, and the name tells accurately what they are. They finish everything but imbecility and weakness, and that they cultivate. They are nicely adapted machines for experimenting on the question, Into how little space a human being can be crushed? I have seen some souls so compressed that they would have fitted into a small thimble, and found room to move there -- wide room. A woman who has been for many years at one of those places carries the mark of the beast on her till she dies.']	0	EMPTY
