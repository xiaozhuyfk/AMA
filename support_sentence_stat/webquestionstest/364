I quite admit that there are defects in the system of government by which Congress is bound to look after the government of the District of Columbia.

Of course a settlement of a controversy on a fundamentally wrong principle of law is greatly to be deplored, but there must of necessity be many rules governing the relations between members of the same society that are more important in that their establishment creates a known rule of action than that they proceed on one principle or another.
